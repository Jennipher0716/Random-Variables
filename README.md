# Random-Variables


Challenge:

1. Get the numerical variables from our dataset.

   - Read the dataset into python
   - Standardized columns
   - Carried out some cleaning and null value checking
   - Also carried out some exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Dropped some categorical colunms since the interest was in numerical

2. Check using a distribution plot if the variables fit the theoretical normal or exponential distribution.

   - used seaborn to plot distributions as per individual variable; income, monthly premium, claim, policy inception, number of policies and total claim amount.

3. Check if any of the transformations (log-transform, etc.) we have seen up to this point changes the result. They did.
